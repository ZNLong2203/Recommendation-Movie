# Project in Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
# Recommendation System

## Introduction
This project is a recommendation system that uses the collaborative filtering technique, matrix factorization, and the SVD algorithm to recommend movies to users. 
The dataset used is the MovieLens dataset, which contains 25 millions ratings from 162541 users on 62423 movies. The dataset is available at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. 
The project is implemented in Python using the Pandas, Sklearn library.

## Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering is a technique used by recommendation systems to make predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users.

## Matrix Factorization
Matrix factorization is a class of collaborative filtering algorithms used in recommendation systems. It decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower-dimensional matrices.

## SVD Algorithm
SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is a matrix factorization technique that is used in recommendation systems to reduce the dimensionality of the user-item interaction matrix.
